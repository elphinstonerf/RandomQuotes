# RandomQuotes
  This is a simple random quote generator. I wanted to learn how to
read from a file to create an array. Then using a random number that 
would be from 1 to the length of the amount of quotes in the text file,
the program will output a random quote. By keeping the quotes in a 
text file, it keeps the program code effecient and readable. It also
allows for easily adding more quotes to the text file to use in the 
future. I decided to also add the date to the greeting, as I wanted to
learn how this process with javascript better.
